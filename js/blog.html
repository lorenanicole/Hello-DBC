		<h2>Wow ... Another Blog??</h2> 

		<div class ="comment more">

		June 26, 2013 <br> <br> Somewhere in April of this year I decided to have a sneak peek into the latest craze of “teach-yourself-coding-to-be-an-amazing-savvy-person-in-the-startup-tech-world”!!! Trolling the internet with searches like “help” or “confused” or any word synonymous with those sentiments (e.g. “kerfuffled) I eventually came across my first break - a 30 day tutorial on Net Tuts by Jeffrey Way. <br> <br>

		Way’s tutorial is joyfully titled, <a href = “http://learncss.tutsplus.com/"> "30 Days to Learn HTML &amp; CSS” </a>. Spending about thirty minutes a day, I slowly began to recall my self taught ways of HTML little by little feeling thrilled at reclaiming my former glory when I use to use HTML to bedazzle my AOL profile with glitz of all colors (I even had an Angelfire tribute website to Sailor Moon .. but that is a story for another day). <br> <br>

		Thirty minutes a day with Way (hey that rhymes!) eventually became forty-five … then sixty … then finally I knew it ... I had caught the coding bug!!!!!! *\(^O^)/* <br> <br>

		After Net Tuts came Code Academy and the JavaScript and Python tracks. Next I discovered the amazing <a href = "http://girldevelopit.com/ "> Girl Develop It </a>community of Chicago and Chicago Women Developers courtesy of MeetUp and I discovered an entire community of 20-somethings like me eager to learn, apply their passion, network, and create! <br> <br>

		Basically this short preface into my new found hobby of learning coding has reminded me of one very simple thing: help is merely one conversation away, one friend removed, or one Hackathon waiting for you to join in. And that being said, my next blog I will send into the digital forest will be about my first successful Hackathon appropriately titled “Everyone Hacks”. <br> <br>

		Good night cosmos and take it from Adventure Time’s Jake the Dog: <br> <br>

		<h2>Three + Two + One (+ 57) Days</h2>

		<div class ="comment more">

		August 30, 2013 == June 26, 2013 + 3 + 2 + 1 (+ 57 Days)
		<br>
		<br>
		While the ceaseless heat of a Windy City summer sludges onward for the imminent Labor Day weekend, it is time for me to put fingertips to QWERTY keyboard. Here, in a 3-2-1 post-modernist-memorandum format, are the last Three + Two + One (+ 57) Days of The Summer of One Windy City-ite’s “I-Want-To-Learn-To-Be-Techy” Exploits:<br> <br>

		3 is for the three words in “Do Good Data”: Doing good data is not as obtuse as it sounds -- it is a collective of non-profit tree-hugger types all wishing for their data to do “good things”. Chaired/founded/cheerleaded by Chicago YMCA’s Andrew Means the inaugural August 2013 Do Good Data conference at the lovely University of Chicago’s Harris School of Public Policy offered a day long series of workshops and chats on all topics related to best data practices, sharing insider stories on how non-profit types are making their data the focus of their stories of “social good”, exploring open source tools for data analysis, and general discussion on how data analysts are making their data act for the social good.<br> <br>

		Given that an entire overview on the takeaways from “Do Good Data” is impractical let me sum the day with one key point. Today we create data by the terabyte (link Sloan Digital Sky Survey) and with our daily interactions increasingly recorded in some (e.g. Facebook/Twitter/LinkedIn) database somewhere our ability to store data is not questioned, it is what we *do* with that data that we need to ponder. So the “data scientist as unicorn [whom has] all the positive attributes of a human all in one” as DataScope Analytics Mike Stringer is not so much a myth as much as it is a potential. Our society can benefit in the broad space of “social good” if we choose to engage data in a user orientated way that defines how we as users can use the data for our own proximation of “social good”.<br> <br>

		2 perhaps reflects the two workshops I attended at the August 2013 Illinois Hispanic Business Expo. The first workshop, “Engaging Your Customers in a Digital Era”, taught me that anything connected to Verizon is not a good workshop. Unless, of course, you want to know how overly simplistic alleged life stories of “digital challenges” can be beautifully solved with Verizon products. The second workshop, aptly named “Social Media”, offered a more unique insight -- Illinois Latino business owners value social media because it permits them a place to showcase their (cultural and professional) authenticity. Most social media chats I have seen fall in line with Naomi Klein’s No Logo argument that social media needs to commodify the human experience to flip a dollar. Ironically the Social Media panel offered a similar but yet different flavored variety of that message simply put social media needs to be authentic. Show you care. Business is family and family is business. Perhaps for Latinos, who may or may not have more familial affinity or who may or may not feel they have more to prove as Professionals with a capital P, social media is a way to bring that authenticity as a credible business owner and as a business owner who cares.<br><br>

		And finally numero uno … Red Cross of Greater Chicago Disaster Action Team application development http://gwob.org/welcoming-the-june-2013-teams/. The project has been slow but insightful. For example, writing user stories!<br><br>

		What is a user story, you declare?! It is a short challenge described from the POV of the user that defines a task for a developer to develop!!<br><br>

		Hypothetical Red Cross Disaster Action Challenge #1: The user is a dispatcher who needs to find the closest volunteers to dispatch to a disaster. Of course the Red Cross has hundreds of volunteers all with complex schedules, contact details, and varying locations.<br> <br>

		How does the dispatcher pinpoint a small subset of volunteers to contact? And how does the dispatcher know whom is actually available or not? Or that the volunteer is the best (as in closest) one to contact?<br><br>

		Let’s write that challenge as a user story! The format goes as follows: “As a [role], I can [feature] so that [reason]”. Therefore the dispatcher headache can be first seen “As a dispatcher, I can find ten volunteers available to respond”. Simple right? Ha. From the example above we see that the user story is only partially defining the task of “volunteer detection” if you will. But alas that is the process of (what I understand to be) agile development: small iterations for the delivery of a MVP (minimally viable product) that can be continuously built upon for improved user engagement and action performance!!!<br> <br>

		Oh and the 57? The number of miles I have logged on Divvy thus far! Divvy of course being the Chicago bike share which has stirred quite a spectrum of passions ranging from utter delight [ME!] to deep deep loathing raggeee (like these condo owners suing because Divvy is too close to their house).<br>
